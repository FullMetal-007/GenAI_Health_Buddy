## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
-   `npm` or `yarn` package manager
-   A [Google AI Studio API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
-   A [Twilio Account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) with a configured WhatsApp Sandbox number.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd genai-health-buddy
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

You'll need to create two `.env` files: one for the frontend (in the root directory) and one for the backend.

**A. Frontend API Key (Root Directory)**

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the project's root folder.
2.  Add your Google Gemini API key:

    ```env
    # .env
    API_KEY=your_google_ai_studio_api_key
    ```

**B. Backend Twilio Credentials (`/backend` directory)**

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd backend`
2.  Create a file named `.env` inside the `backend` folder.
3.  Add your Twilio credentials:

    ```env
    # backend/.env
    TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
    TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
    TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=whatsapp:+14155238886 # Use your Twilio Sandbox number
    ```

### 3. Install Dependencies & Run

You need to run the backend server and the frontend development server in two separate terminals.

**A. Start the Backend Server**

```bash
# In your first terminal, from the /backend directory
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
```

The backend server will start on `http://localhost:3001`.

**B. Start the Frontend App**

Since this project uses ES modules via an `importmap`, you don't need to run `npm install` for the frontend. You just need a simple local server to serve the `index.html` file.

A common way to do this is with the `serve` package:

```bash
# In your second terminal, from the project's root directory
npx serve
```

The server will provide a URL, typically `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your browser to use the application.
