## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended for native `fetch` support)
-   `npm` or `yarn` package manager
-   A [Google Gemini API Key]
-   A [Meta Developer Account](https://developers.facebook.com/) and a configured Meta App with the WhatsApp Business Platform.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd genai-health-buddy
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

You'll need to create two `.env` files: one for the frontend (in the root directory) and one for the backend. The application code expects these to be loaded into the environment.

**A. Frontend API Key (Root Directory)**

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the project's root folder.
2.  Add your Google Gemini API key:

    ```env
    # .env
    API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```

**B. Backend Meta Credentials (`/backend` directory)**

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd backend`
2.  Create a file named `.env` inside the `backend` folder.
3.  Add your Meta WhatsApp Business API credentials. You can get these from your app's dashboard under "WhatsApp" > "API Setup".

    ```env
    # backend/.env
    META_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_phone_number_id
    META_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_temporary_or_permanent_access_token
    ```

### 3. Install Dependencies & Run

You need to run the backend server and the frontend development server in two separate terminals.

**A. Start the Backend Server**

```bash
# In your first terminal, from the /backend directory
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
```

The backend server will start on `http://localhost:3001`.

**B. Start the Frontend App**

Since this project uses ES modules via an `importmap`, you don't need to run `npm install` for the frontend. You just need a simple local server to serve the `index.html` file.

A common way to do this is with the `serve` package:

```bash
# In your second terminal, from the project's root directory
npx serve
```

The server will provide a URL, typically `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your browser to use the application.
